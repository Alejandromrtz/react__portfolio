# react__portfolio

created a very minimal portfolio to display who I am and the projects I have created!
by any chance if you see this, leave a review in the contact me section of the project.



This project consisted of HTML, CSS, and Javascript but was created in a react app... so will implement react into it as I continue on with this project.
